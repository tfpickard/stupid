An exploration of glitch aesthetics, where digital errors become intentional artistic choices.

## Concept

What happens when we embrace the failures and artifacts of digital media? This piece investigates:
- Compression artifacts as texture
- Color channel separation
- Data corruption as composition

<Callout type="warning">
This image intentionally contains visual glitches and may appear "broken" - that's the point.
</Callout>

## Process

1. Start with a base photograph
2. Apply intentional data corruption
3. Separate and shift RGB channels
4. Add compression artifacts through multiple save cycles
5. Recombine layers with blend modes

## Why Glitch Art?

In a world obsessed with perfect 4K imagery, there's something refreshing about celebrating the imperfections. Digital glitches remind us that our technology is fragile, beautiful, and strange.
