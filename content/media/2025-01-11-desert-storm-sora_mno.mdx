## Cinematic Scale

This prompt aimed to capture the raw power and scale of nature—something that requires both technical precision and artistic vision from the AI.

## Breaking Down the Prompt

**Environmental Elements**:
- "Massive sandstorm" - establishes the main subject
- "Swirling dust clouds hundreds of feet tall" - specific scale
- "Lightning strikes within the storm" - dynamic action

**Cinematography**:
- "Epic wide shot" - framing choice
- "Camera slowly pushing forward" - creates tension and engagement
- "IMAX quality" - reference point for production value

**Atmosphere**:
- "Dramatic orange and purple sky" - specific color grading
- "Intense atmosphere" - emotional tone

## Technical Achievement

The combination of large-scale environmental effects (sandstorm) with specific phenomena (lightning) tests Sora's ability to handle multiple complex simulations simultaneously.

## Color Grading Notes

The orange/purple palette creates a surreal, almost apocalyptic mood. This color combination also helps with visual clarity—the storm reads clearly against the colored sky.

## Future Iterations

Next experiment: Add a lone figure or vehicle for scale reference. The human element could increase the dramatic impact.
