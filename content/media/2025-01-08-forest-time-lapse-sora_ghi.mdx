## The Challenge

Capturing the passage of time while maintaining spatial coherence is notoriously difficult for AI video models. This prompt tested Sora's ability to handle temporal continuity.

## Technical Notes

**Key Elements**:
- Fixed camera position (critical for consistency)
- Specific seasonal markers (blossoms, leaves, snow)
- Lighting consistency ("golden hour throughout")
- Natural progression

## Results

Sora maintained the tree's core structure while smoothly transitioning the seasonal details. The golden hour lighting instruction helped unify the different seasons visually.

## Prompt Insights

Using "continuous camera position" was essential. Earlier attempts without this resulted in slight camera drift between seasons.
