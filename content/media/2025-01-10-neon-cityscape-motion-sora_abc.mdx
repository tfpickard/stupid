## The Vision

An immersive journey through a futuristic metropolis where technology and urban life blend seamlessly. The AI captured the essence of cyberpunk aesthetics while maintaining photorealistic quality.

## Technical Approach

**Camera Movement**: Smooth aerial tracking shot that weaves between buildings
**Lighting**: Neon signs and holographic displays create dynamic color shifts
**Atmosphere**: Rain and fog add depth and mood to the scene

## What Worked

The prompt's emphasis on "light trails" and "rain-slicked streets" gave Sora specific visual elements to anchor the generation. The cinematic camera movement instruction helped create a professional, fluid motion.
