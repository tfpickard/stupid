## Concept

Exploring the boundary between reality and abstraction - where does the ocean end and art begin?

## Creative Process

This piece emerged from experimenting with transformation prompts. The key was using "gradually transforming" rather than an instant cut, which allowed Sora to create a smooth, dreamlike transition.

**Color Palette**: Started with realistic ocean blues, evolved into vibrant artistic colors
**Motion**: Maintained the wave dynamics throughout the transformation
**Style Blend**: Photorealism → Impressionism → Abstract

## Learnings

Sora excels at morphing between states when given clear transition language. The slow-motion instruction helped maintain detail during the transformation phase.
