This is an example Sora video creation showcasing the power of AI-generated video.

A dreamlike journey through impossible landscapes, geometric shapes transforming into organic forms, vibrant colors bleeding into each other, camera slowly floating through space
</PromptBlock>

## Creative Process

The prompt was iterated several times to achieve the right balance between:
- **Abstract vs concrete**: Finding imagery that felt both familiar and alien
- **Motion**: Ensuring smooth, hypnotic camera movement
- **Color palette**: Vibrant but not overwhelming

## Technical Notes

- Duration: ~10 seconds
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Generated using Sora 1.0

## What I Learned

Creating with Sora taught me that the best results come from prompts that are:
1. Specific about motion and camera movement
2. Rich in visual detail without being overly prescriptive
3. Focused on mood and atmosphere

The AI excels at transitions and morphing - lean into that.
