## Design Philosophy

Sometimes the most compelling AI video isn't about realism—it's about creating something that would be impossible to film in the physical world.

## Visual Structure

This piece explores **sacred geometry** and **perfect symmetry**, two elements that Sora handles exceptionally well. The infinite tunnel creates a sense of depth while the kaleidoscope effect maintains visual interest.

**Color Theory**:
- Metallic gold = warmth and luxury
- Deep purple = mystery and depth
- High contrast for visual impact

**Motion Design**:
- Continuous rotation prevents static moments
- Zoom creates the "tunnel" effect
- Symmetry maintained throughout

## Creating Loops

The "hypnotic loop" instruction encouraged Sora to create motion that could seamlessly repeat. While not a perfect loop, the beginning and end are visually similar enough for near-seamless playback.

## Why It Works

Geometric patterns are mathematically precise, which plays to Sora's strengths. Unlike organic subjects that can look "off," abstract geometry is forgiving while remaining visually stunning.
